                <h2>Development and Design</h2>
                <p>
                    The BMW M3 GTR was developed in the early 2000s to compete in the American Le Mans Series (ALMS).
                    The car was created to compete against other manufacturers in the GT class, most notably Porsche.
                    The M3 GTR features a modified E46 M3 chassis with extensive use of carbon fiber to reduce weight.
                    It has a wider body and aggressive aerodynamics, including a large rear wing and front splitter for
                    increased downforce.

                <h2>Engine and Performance</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most significant changes in the M3 GTR is its engine. Unlike the standard M3's inline-six
                    engine, the GTR is powered by a 4.0-liter V8 engine, designated as the P60B40.
                    This V8 engine produces approximately 493 horsepower, providing the car with exceptional
                    acceleration and top speed.
                    The M3 GTR can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in around 3.4 seconds and has a top speed of over 190
                    mph, depending on the configuration.

                <h2>Racing Achievements</h2>
                <p>
                    The BMW M3 GTR made its racing debut in 2001 in the ALMS. It quickly established itself as a
                    formidable competitor, winning several races and clinching the championship in its debut season.
                    The M3 GTR also achieved success at the 24 Hours of NÃ¼rburgring, one of the most grueling endurance
                    races in the world.

                <h2>Homologation and Road Version</h2>
                <p>
                    To comply with racing regulations, BMW produced a limited number of road-going versions of the M3
                    GTR, known as the M3 GTR Strassenversion.
                    The road version of the M3 GTR retains much of the racing car's performance attributes but is
                    slightly detuned for street use. It features a more refined interior and additional comfort features
                    compared to the race car.

                <h2>Legacy and Influence</h2>
                <p>
                    The success and performance of the M3 GTR influenced subsequent M3 models, pushing the boundaries of
                    what BMW's M division could achieve.
                    The M3 GTR gained significant popularity in automotive culture, partly due to its appearance in
                    video games like the Need for Speed series and its striking design.

                <h2>Collectibility and Value</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to its limited production numbers and racing heritage, the M3 GTR is a highly sought-after
                    collector's item. Both the race cars and the road versions are extremely rare.
                    The value of an M3 GTR has appreciated significantly over the years, with pristine examples fetching
                    high prices at auctions and among collectors.
